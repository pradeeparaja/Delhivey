## 📊 Overview
This repository contains the analysis and findings from the Delhivey delivery case study. The objective is to understand the delivery patterns, customer behaviors, and operational efficiencies within the delivery ecosystem.

## 📚 Data Sources
- **Customer Data**: Information on customer demographics and order history.
- **Order Data**: Records of deliveries, including timestamps and status.
- **Product Data**: Details of products available for delivery.
- **Operational Metrics**: Data reflecting operational efficiencies and performance metrics.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **Data Cleaning**: Scripts and processes used to prepare data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Insights derived from the initial analysis of the data.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of predictive models for delivery time estimation.
- **Recommendations**: Strategic recommendations based on analysis findings.

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights
### Key Questions Addressed
1. What are the peak delivery hours during the week?
2. How do customer demographics affect delivery preferences?
3. What factors contribute to delivery delays?
4. What is the average delivery time across different product categories?
5. Are there any geographic patterns in delivery efficiency?

## 📈 Insights and Conclusions
